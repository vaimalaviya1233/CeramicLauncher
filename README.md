### What I intend to do with Quickstep
The plan is to make a vary simple recent apps screen, and make gestures work properly, but with a twist:
Since quickstep providers also control how gestures work on android 10, I intend to make a quicksettings-like screen that appears when the user swipes up from one of the bottom corners of the screen. Of course, I'm a complete noob when it comes to quickstep or any hidden api, so I didn't do it yet.
